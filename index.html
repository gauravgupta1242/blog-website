                enhancements or fun visual touches can help center our focus on the meeting itself. As part of this goal, we recently announced ways to blur and replace 
                your background in Google Meet, which use machine learning (ML) to better highlight participants regardless of their surroundings. Whereas other solutions 
                require installing additional software, Meet’s features are powered by cutting-edge web ML technologies built with MediaPipe that work directly in your
                browser — no extra steps necessary. One key goal in developing these features was to provide real-time, in-browser performance on almost all modern devices,
                hich we accomplished by combining efficient on-device ML models, WebGL-based rendering, and web-based ML inference via XNNPACK and TFLite.
